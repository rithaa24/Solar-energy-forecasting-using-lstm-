# Solar Energy Optimization Using LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on optimizing solar energy output using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**. By leveraging deep learning, we predict energy production based on historical weather data, helping improve efficiency and planning for solar farms.

## 🚀 Features
- Forecasts solar power generation using **LSTM neural networks**.
- Uses **historical weather data** (solar radiation, temperature, humidity, etc.).
- Helps in **energy management** and **cost reduction**.
- Can be integrated into **smart grids** for real-time optimization.
